# Hi, I’m Thad McNeely

Cloud, security, and AI-focused engineer building **local-first LLM agent systems**, automation tools, and production web applications.

I enjoy solving real problems with practical engineering—especially where **cloud infrastructure, intelligent systems, and software delivery** intersect.

---

## What I focus on

* **Cloud & Dev Platforms:** AWS, Azure, containerized local services
* **Security Foundations:** Network, system, and defensive security principles
* **AI & Agent Systems:** Local LLM workflows, memory layering, retrieval, automation
* **Full-Stack Delivery:** Next.js, React, Tailwind, deployment pipelines, real client builds
* **Practical Engineering:** tools and systems meant to be run, tested, and used—not just demos
