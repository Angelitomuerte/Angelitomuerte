Hi, I’m Thad McNeely

Cloud, security, and AI-focused engineer building local-first LLM agent systems, automation tools, and production web applications.

I enjoy solving real problems with practical engineering—especially where cloud infrastructure, intelligent systems, and software delivery intersect.

What I focus on

Cloud & Dev Platforms: AWS, Azure, containerized local services

Security Foundations: Network, system, and defensive security principles

AI & Agent Systems: Local LLM workflows, memory layering, retrieval, automation

Full-Stack Delivery: Next.js, React, Tailwind, deployment pipelines, real client builds

Practical Engineering: tools and systems meant to be run, tested, and used—not just demos
